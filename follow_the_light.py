        Follow The Light Task
        -------------------

        This task is a simple visual task where the mouse has
        to poke the center port to start a trial.
        After the center port is poked,
        one of the two side ports will be illuminated.
        If the mouse licks the correct side port, it receives a reward.
        If the mouse licks the wrong side port, it receives a punishment.

        It contains 2 training stages:
        - Training stage 1: Only one side port is illuminated and gives reward.
                            No punishment is given, and the mouse can choose again.
        - Training stage 2: Both ports are illuminated with different intensity.
                            Brighter port gives reward, the other one gives punishment.

        The progression through the stages is defined in the training_settings.py file.
