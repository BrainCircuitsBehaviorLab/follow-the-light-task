class TrainingProtocol(Training):
    """
    This class defines the training protocol for animal behavior experiments.
    The training protocol is run every time a task is finished and it determines:
    1. Which new task is scheduled for the subject
    2. How training variables change based on performance metrics

    Required methods to implement:
    - __init__: Initialize the training protocol
    - default_training_settings: Define initial parameters. It is called when creating a new subject.
    - update_training_settings: Update parameters after each session.

    Optional method:
    - gui_tabs: Organize the variables in custom GUI tabs
